# Session Debrief – 2025-09-27 23:55 UTC

## Key Deliverables
- Unified admin DTO exports in `@colanode/core`/client UI and propagated server role + workspace metadata through account services, keeping TypeScript builds green across web and desktop.
- Hardened server account creation flows: Google OAuth and workspace invites now persist `server_role`, admin password-reset routes use exported OTP helpers, and audit replies return consistent 4xx codes.
- `/config` response respects `SERVER_VERSION`/`SERVER_SHA`/`SERVER_NAME` overrides so deployed servers report real build info to clients.

## Outstanding Work
- Run full TypeScript/ lint pipelines and Docker builds once a Node ≥20 toolchain with `tsc` is available.
- Cut a follow-up release tag that updates `build.version`/`build.sha` so packaged artifacts match the reported metadata.

## Next Session Resume
- Use Node ≥20: `nvm use 20 && npm install` (root) before rerunning `npm run build -w @colanode/server` / Docker image builds.
- After install, re-run `npm run lint` and `npm run build -w @colanode/web` to verify no regressions.
- Last commit hash: 449811a088e3e03c6bdfb8abb2243fd0bc57d932

## Error Log
- `npm run build -w @colanode/server` → `tsc: not found` (current environment lacks global TypeScript binary).
- `npx tsc -p packages/client/tsconfig.json` required installing `typescript`, blocked until toolchain upgrade.

## Notes
- Set `SERVER_VERSION`, `SERVER_SHA`, and `SERVER_NAME` env vars (e.g. in Docker `.env`) to match deploy metadata.
- Server/client now expect admin summaries from `@colanode/core`; ensure corresponding packages are rebuilt before publishing.
