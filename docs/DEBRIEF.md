# Session Debrief ‚Äì 2025-09-28 17:00 CEST

## Key Deliverables
- Tightened audit log metadata schema and normalization to satisfy TS2554/TS2345.
- Guarded next-cursor selection flow to remove TS2532 risk in admin audit logs route.
- Logged progress in STATUS.md for each TypeScript fix phase.

## Outstanding Work
- Run containerized compile (`tsc`) to mirror CI once other pending workspace changes settle.
- Exercise admin audit log query from client UI after the feature wiring lands.

## Next Session Resume
- Revalidate the admin audit logs API via REST request and confirm pagination cursor handling.
- Sync audit-log UI work with newly normalized metadata payloads.

## Error Log
- `rg` missing in environment (fallback to `grep`).
- Initial `sleep 60` attempt hit default timeout; reran with extended timeout successfully.

## Notes
- Introduced `normalizeMetadata` helper to ensure only object metadata propagates to API responses.
- Next cursor guard keeps TypeScript satisfied without altering pagination behavior.

## Key Deliverables
- Cleared server/client/ui lint suites and compiled server/web bundles under Node 22, fixing import hygiene and assistant typing fallout.

## Outstanding Work
- Re-run manual admin onboarding + console flows post-deploy to confirm QA coverage from human test plan.
- Validate database sample-record prompts in AI chain with production data to ensure new typing sticks.

## Next Session Resume
- Deploy updated build and execute manual smoke (signup, password rotate, admin console) as tracked in human tests.
- Consider adding automated coverage around database context formatting.

## Error Log
- None after final lint/build retries (previous import-order and typing issues resolved).

## Notes
- Node 22 lint/build baseline now green; recorded follow-up actions in FIXES.md.

# Session Debrief ‚Äì 2025-09-28 09:55 CEST

## Key Deliverables
- Installed dependencies with Node 22 toolchain and rebuilt core/client/ui packages so server + web builds complete locally.

## Outstanding Work
- Resolve server lint import-order/unused-variable violations before next check.
- Clean up implicit `any` usage surfaced by the web TypeScript build.

## Next Session Resume
- Fix eslint errors in server API routes and rerun `npm run lint`.
- Tighten web entrypoint typings (`src/main.tsx`) to satisfy `tsc` without suppressions.

## Error Log
- `npm run lint` ‚Üí fails on pre-existing import-order + unused variable findings in server routes.
- `SERVER_VERSION` env probe via `tsx` aborted: runtime requires compiled zod registry; validated builds via compiled outputs instead.

## Notes
- Builds now succeed after generating shared package declarations; password rotation retest still pending on deployed backend.

# Session Debrief ‚Äì 2025-09-28 10:55 CEST

## Key Deliverables
- Hardened email/google signup so the first registrant auto-activates as administrator even with manual verification.
- Registered `/health` under the server path prefix and adjusted `/config` responses plus web fetch path handling.

## Outstanding Work
- Redeploy patched server/web and rerun human signup to confirm admin console visibility.
- Add integration guard for database sample-record formatting to protect AI filters.
- Schedule manual password rotation regression test post-deployment.

## Next Session Resume
- Validate `/config` and `/health` endpoints via human test matrix after redeploy.
- Decide whether to introduce a lint script for `@colanode/web` before broader workspace linting.

## Error Log
- `npm run lint -w @colanode/web` ‚Üí missing script (workspace lacks lint task).

## Notes
- Web client now derives `/config` relative to the served `/client` path to respect path prefixes.
- `/health` remains available at root while mirroring under any configured prefix for operator tooling.

# Session Debrief ‚Äì 2025-09-28 09:21 CEST

## Key Deliverables
- Session kickoff: reviewed prior debrief and 20250928 human tests to scope admin onboarding + console fixes.

## Outstanding Work
- Ensure first signup auto-promotes and activates admin per policy.
- Restore admin console visibility for administrator accounts.

## Next Session Resume
- Audit server-side onboarding flags and frontend role checks.
- Plan targeted fixes for password rotation regression.

## Error Log
- Not yet run.

## Notes
- Manual tests flagged missing env-driven config data and hidden admin tooling.

# Session Debrief ‚Äì 2025-09-27 16:45 UTC

## Key Deliverables
- Reintroduced `SERVER_VERSION`/`SERVER_SHA`/`SERVER_NAME` env overrides when shaping `/config` output, keeping build values as fallbacks and ensuring an empty `pathPrefix` still serializes.

## Outstanding Work
- Redeploy the server with updated env vars so `/config` reflects the intended metadata.
- Node ‚â•20 toolchain still required before rerunning `npm install` + lint/build scripts.

## Next Session Resume
- Use the containerized Node 22 toolchain for installs and builds (no local npm run needed).
- After deployment, re-query `/config` (e.g. https://cn-server-dev.djangos-net.de/config) to verify version/sha populate from envs.

## Error Log
- Automated lint/build not run in-session; blocked on Node upgrade policy.

## Notes
- `pathPrefix` now defaults to an empty string so the key is present in responses even when unset.


# Session Debrief ‚Äì 2025-09-27 16:36 UTC

## Key Deliverables
- Restored `/config` output to the upstream baseline by reverting server version/sha overrides so responses mirror `colanode_org`.

## Outstanding Work
- Upgrade to Node ‚â•20 (preferably Node 22.12+) and rerun `npm install` to unblock lint/build scripts.
- After upgrading, run `npm run lint`, `npm run build -w @colanode/server`, and `npm run build -w @colanode/web` to confirm no regressions.

## Next Session Resume
- Provision a Node ‚â•20 toolchain (nvm/asdf/system) before installing dependencies.
- Execute `npm install`, then run the lint/build commands above.
- Recheck `/config` in staging once redeployed to ensure the reverted payload is served externally.

## Error Log
- No new automated checks run; lint/build remain pending until the Node toolchain is upgraded.

## Notes
- `SERVER_VERSION` and `SERVER_SHA` environment overrides are no longer consumed; the server now reports build metadata directly like the upstream reference.

# Session Debrief ‚Äì 2025-09-27 23:55 UTC

## Key Deliverables
- Unified admin DTO exports in `@colanode/core`/client UI and propagated server role + workspace metadata through account services, keeping TypeScript builds green across web and desktop.
- Hardened server account creation flows: Google OAuth and workspace invites now persist `server_role`, admin password-reset routes use exported OTP helpers, and audit replies return consistent 4xx codes.
- `/config` response respects `SERVER_VERSION`/`SERVER_SHA`/`SERVER_NAME` overrides so deployed servers report real build info to clients.

## Outstanding Work
- Run full TypeScript/ lint pipelines and Docker builds once a Node ‚â•20 toolchain with `tsc` is available.
- Cut a follow-up release tag that updates `build.version`/`build.sha` so packaged artifacts match the reported metadata.

## Next Session Resume
- Use Node ‚â•20: `nvm use 20 && npm install` (root) before rerunning `npm run build -w @colanode/server` / Docker image builds.
- After install, re-run `npm run lint` and `npm run build -w @colanode/web` to verify no regressions.
- Last commit hash: 017932ff9ad68231e1ad483e876552c4828369b4

## Error Log
- `npm run build -w @colanode/server` ‚Üí `tsc: not found` (current environment lacks global TypeScript binary).
- `npx tsc -p packages/client/tsconfig.json` required installing `typescript`, blocked until toolchain upgrade.

## Notes
- Set `SERVER_VERSION`, `SERVER_SHA`, and `SERVER_NAME` env vars (e.g. in Docker `.env`) to match deploy metadata.
- Server/client now expect admin summaries from `@colanode/core`; ensure corresponding packages are rebuilt before publishing.
