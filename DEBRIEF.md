# Session Debrief – 2025-09-28 20:38 CEST

## Summary
- Imported React JSX types and enforced non-empty admin section tuple to clear sidebar-admin TypeScript diagnostics.

## Priority 1
- Admin settings sidebar restructure pending UX verification and human test rerun.

## Errors
- compile.log missing in workspace; noted while attempting to review build output.


# Session Debrief – 2025-09-28 21:06 CEST

## Summary
- Updated admin sidebar icon typings to use LucideIcon so lucide-react components satisfy TS2322.

## Priority 1
- Admin settings sidebar restructure pending UX verification and human test rerun.

## Errors
- compile.log still missing in workspace; build log review blocked.
- rg command unavailable; used grep fallback.


# Session Debrief – 2025-09-28 21:25 CEST

## Summary
- Routed Admin settings through left drawer via new admin/settings tab while keeping Accounts, Workspaces, Audit Logs subsections.

## Priority 1
- Admin settings drawer flow pending human UX verification to confirm parity with prior standalone view.

## Errors
- None.


# Session Debrief – 2025-09-28 19:57 CEST

## Summary
- Moved Accounts, Workspaces, Audit Logs into Admin Settings sidebar sections and added refresh/reset hooks per panel.

## Priority 1
- Admin settings sidebar restructure pending UX verification and human test rerun.

## Errors
- Initial attempts to read DEBRIEF.md and HUMAN_TESTS.md failed because the files were absent in the workspace.

# Session Debrief – 2025-09-29 10:34 CEST

## Summary
- Investigated 404s against documented API endpoints; server mounts client routes beneath /client/v1 (and optional config.server.pathPrefix) while docs/tests target root paths.

## Priority 1
- Align documentation and scripted checks with actual /client/v1 base path or adjust Fastify registration to expose endpoints at documented locations.

## Errors
- None.


# Session Debrief – 2025-09-29 11:12 CEST

## Summary
- Documented /client/v1 namespace across API reference and tests; confirmed apps/server/src/api/index.ts mounts clientRoutes at `${prefix}/client/v1` where `prefix` = config.server.pathPrefix when set.

## Priority 1
- None.

## Errors
- None.


# Session Debrief – 2025-09-29 11:32 CEST

## Summary
- Synced legacy documentation references (docs/API_ENDPOINTS_org.md, docs/meta/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) with the /client/v1 namespace and ensured alignment with Fastify path prefixes.

## Priority 1
- None.

## Errors
- None.


# Session Debrief – 2025-09-29 19:59 CEST

## Summary
- Ran live curl checks against cn-server-dev; /client/v1/workspaces/... rejects API token with 401 while /rest/v1/workspaces responds 200 with the same token, confirming namespace split and auth expectations.

## Errors
- Provided API token (prefix cna_) is not valid for /client/v1 account routes; device tokens (prefix cnd_) remain required.


# Session Debrief – 2025-09-30 13:40 CEST

## Summary
- Added device-token scopes (read_only vs approval_full), database migration, and middleware enforcement across client routes.
- Implemented `/client/v1/auth/device-tokens` to mint scoped device tokens using either device or workspace API credentials and updated documentation.

## Priority 1
- Deploy updated server build so `/client/v1/auth/device-tokens` becomes available for remote verification.

## Errors
- `sleep 60` without explicit timeout timed out at 10s; reran with extended timeout to satisfy step-delay rule.
- POST https://cn-server-dev.djangos-net.de/client/v1/auth/device-tokens (cna token) returned 404; remote environment still on previous release.


# Session Debrief – 2025-09-30 13:41 CEST

## Summary
- Narrowed `statusForApiTokenError` return type to the allowed status-code union so device token issuance compiles cleanly.

## Priority 1
- None.

## Errors
- `compile.log` missing when attempting to review build output; noted during resume checklist.


# Session Debrief – 2025-09-30 05:31 CEST

## Summary
- Canonicalized device-token scope ordering so stored JSON matches middleware expectations and documented examples.
- Documented end-to-end issuance + usage flow for `cnd_` tokens in `docs/API_ENDPOINTS.md`.
- Attempted remote issuance and workspace fetch to validate the flow.

## Priority 1
- Secure valid workspace API token to complete live verification of `GET /client/v1/workspaces` with a freshly minted `cnd_` device token.

## Errors
- Remote POST `/client/v1/auth/device-tokens` with provided `cna_` sample returned `token_invalid` (secret mismatch), blocking verification request.

# Session Debrief – 2025-09-30 05:40 CEST

## Summary
- Tried issuing new device token with provided R/W workspace token; API responded with {"code":"unknown"}.

## Priority 1
- Investigate server-side failure preventing device token issuance via workspace token.

## Errors
- Issuance endpoint returned {"code":"unknown","message":"An unexpected error occurred."} when called with cna_01k6a8sexdnp7t39jh0fa5r2ntat42ba7b9914d04467924896b8ccf72d38918df196ab134b26a4e88b39b4362c41.

# Session Debrief – 2025-09-30 05:55 CEST

## Summary
- Local npm server build initially failed (DeviceTokenScope exports missing) before succeeding after rebuilding @colanode/core.

## Priority 1
- Launch @colanode/server on port 7777 and verify /client/v1/auth/device-tokens with cna_ sample.

## Errors
- `npm run build -w @colanode/server` returned TS2305/TS2724/TS2353 errors until @colanode/core rebuild refreshed device-token exports.

# Session Debrief – 2025-09-30 05:58 CEST

## Summary
- Enabled SERVER_PORT override in config and rebuilt @colanode/server for port-7777 debugging.

## Priority 1
- Start server with SERVER_PORT=7777 and validate /client/v1/auth/device-tokens locally using cna_ credentials.

## Errors
- None.

# Session Debrief – 2025-09-30 06:01 CEST

## Summary
- Attempted SERVER_PORT=7777 launch; tsx dev run failed with EPERM on /tmp pipe, and dist startup aborted on missing STORAGE_/POSTGRES/REDIS configuration.

## Priority 1
- Provision required backing services/secrets (Postgres, Redis, S3 storage) so local server can bind on port 7777 for device-token tests.

## Errors
- `npm run dev -w @colanode/server` raised `EPERM` listening on `/tmp/user/1000/tsx-*/pipe` under sandboxed environment.
- `node apps/server/dist/index.js` exited with storage/Postgres/Redis configuration validation errors.

# Session Debrief – 2025-09-30 06:15 CEST

## Summary
- Configured Pino to mirror structured logs to `/var/log/colanode/server.log` while preserving stdout.
- Added request/response hook logging method, path, status, and duration for all API calls.
- Exposed `/client/v1/admin/logs/tail` and `/client/v1/admin/logs/errors` endpoints and documented usage.

## Priority 1
- Verify filesystem permissions allow writing/reading `/var/log/colanode/server.log` in deployment environments.

## Errors
- None.

# Session Debrief – 2025-09-30 06:21 CEST

## Summary
- Attempted to load compile.log for server TypeScript diagnostics but file is absent in the workspace.
- Reworked Fastify logging hooks to use WeakMap timers, reply.elapsedTime fallback, and routeOptions/url path selection to satisfy TypeScript checks.

## Priority 1
- None.

## Errors
- compile.log missing while resuming TypeScript diagnostics review.

# Session Debrief – 2025-09-30 06:42 CEST

## Summary
- Inspected apps/server/src/api/client/routes/auth/device-token-issue.ts to trace cna_ issuance logic; database insert relies on the new devices.scopes column added in migration 00034.
- Remote 500 responses likely originate from production instances where the migration has not yet run, so inserting scopes triggers a SQL error that the error handler surfaces as ApiErrorCode.Unknown.

## Priority 1
- Ensure devices table migration (00034) is applied before deploying the updated device-token issuance flow.

## Errors
- Remote verification blocked by sandbox networking; unable to confirm via live curl until migration status is resolved.

# Session Debrief – 2025-09-30 06:45 CEST

## Summary
- Confirmed production schema already includes devices.scopes; adjusted apps/server/src/api/client/routes/auth/device-token-issue.ts to trim platform/version values to 30 characters so inserts honor varchar limits.

## Priority 1
- Re-test device-token issuance once remote access is available to ensure string truncation resolves prior 500 responses.

## Errors
- None.

# Session Debrief – 2025-09-30 06:50 CEST

## Summary
- Created hosting/tests/device_token_test.sh to exercise the issuance and follow-up workspace request end-to-end using curl and jq with env-provided tokens.

## Priority 1
- Run the script against the live server after networking access is restored to verify the flow succeeds.

## Errors
- None.

# Session Debrief – 2025-09-30 06:55 CEST

## Summary
- Examined device_token_response.log and server logs; the 500 originates from Fastify error FST_ERR_CTP_EMPTY_JSON_BODY after an HTTP→HTTPS redirect drops the JSON payload, and our error handler maps the parse failure to ApiErrorCode.Unknown.

## Priority 1
- Decide whether to tolerate empty JSON by defaulting to {} or adjust client calls to avoid redirects so Fastify receives the body intact.

## Errors
- None.

# Session Debrief – 2025-09-30 07:02 CEST

## Summary
- Added tolerant JSON parser in apps/server/src/app.ts so empty bodies parse as {} and defaulted request.body casting in apps/server/src/api/client/routes/auth/device-token-issue.ts to guard against undefined payloads after redirects.

## Priority 1
- Coordinate with infra to ensure proxy redirects preserve POST bodies; current parser workaround unblocks issuance but long-term fix lives in proxy config.

## Errors
- None.

# Session Debrief – 2025-09-30 07:10 CEST

## Summary
- Extended JSON parser to normalize Buffer payloads before parsing and limited device-token scope handling to actual arrays, protecting against TypeScript regressions introduced by the redirect workaround.

## Priority 1
- Await rerun of device_token_test.sh to confirm issuance now succeeds with the tolerant parser.

## Errors
- compile.log still absent when checking for TypeScript status.

# Session Debrief – 2025-09-30 07:24 CEST

## Summary
- Confirmed /client/v1/accounts/emails/login handler uses email/password schema and argon2 verification (apps/server/src/api/client/routes/accounts/email-login.ts:24, packages/core/src/types/accounts.ts:53, apps/server/src/lib/accounts.ts:55).
- Verified route mounts through accounts/index.ts:21, routes/index.ts:13, api/index.ts:15 ensuring /client/v1/accounts/emails/login exposure.
- Flagged buildLoginSuccessOutput device insert (apps/server/src/lib/accounts.ts:86) as potential failure point if devices.scopes migration missing.

## Priority 1
- Validate devices.scopes migration and login device insert path to restore /client/v1/accounts/emails/login.

## Errors
- `sleep 10` exited 124 due to default timeout; reran with python3 sleep workaround.
- `python` binary unavailable when attempting sleep helper.
- `cat compile.log` failed (ENOENT).

# Session Debrief – 2025-09-30 07:42 CEST

## Summary
- Identified Redis rate-limit dependency as source of /client/v1/accounts/emails/login 500s and wrapped redis.incr/expire with fallback logging (apps/server/src/lib/rate-limits.ts:16-38).

## Priority 1
- Run hosting/tests/api_tests.sh to confirm login succeeds with Redis unavailable.

## Errors
- None.
